# LSmetrics_testes_re
Tests for LS_metrics main procedures for patch ids in temporal series, and for generalized_zonal_stats defs

### Last version of LSmetrics tested available at
https://github.com/LEEClab/LS_METRICS

### Original scripts
https://github.com/mauriciovancine/GRASS-GIS-Landscape-Metrics/tree/master/scripts

#### Comments
- The script which calculates patch number in zonal statistics depends on LSmetrics outputs of pids (patch id info); 
- LSmetrics gui works well for a single raster, but apparently is not running the option for a sequence of rasters with a string common pattern in raster file name.
